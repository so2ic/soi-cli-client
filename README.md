# SO2IC CLI CLIENT

CLI client for the so2ic implementation

## Purpose

This is the cli client for the Shards Of Inifinity In C implementation. Shards of Infinty is a deckbuilding game that you could see [here](https://iello.fr/jeux/shards-of-infinity/). \
The purpose of this reimplementation in C is to challenge me a bit by making a client server game in pure C. Actually, the goal is to learn as much as I can in C :). \

This client is made so I can test "quickly" the features of the [server](https://www.github.com/so2ic/soi-server). \
I'm also trying to make it so it's playable and learn a bit more abour CLI app in C. \

## Requirement

- *make*
- *clang* / *gcc*

## Usage

- build using `make`
- run `./bin/exe`
